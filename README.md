# Lumous Findings

This repository contains a collection of findings, experiments, and demos created during the learning and prototyping phase of the **Lumous Valley** project. These materials serve as a sandbox for exploring ideas and practicing implementation techniques, particularly using the **raylib** framework.

## Purpose

The experiments in this repository are primarily intended for learning and practicing game development with **raylib**. They support the broader goal of developing concepts and tools for the Lumous Valley project.

## Repository Structure

- All experiments and demos should be placed within the `experiments/` directory.
- Each contributor must use a personal subdirectory within `experiments/`, named after their username.
- Contributions may be developed individually or collaboratively, depending on the nature of the task.
